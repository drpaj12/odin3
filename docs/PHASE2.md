# Odin III — Phase 2: Verilog-2005 front end

Spec: `docs/DESIGN.md` §4 (§4.0 project input, §4.1 Verilog-2005), §6 steps 1–4, §12. Exit test
(decision #4): every Verilog micro in `tests/micro/verilog` and every VTR benchmark in the Phase 2
test set reads, elaborates and runs `proc`/`opt`, and the result is identical (`netlist-compare`)
or equivalent (`equiv-check`) to the Parmys golden; micros Parmys itself rejects are listed
exceptions. The phase-2 project-corpus cases (`tests/golden/projects`) read in all their Phase 2
formats and match their oracles.

Each sub-project gets its own spec (`docs/specs/`), plan, and PRs. Model/effort per
`docs/PHASE0.md` §9 (grammar, preprocessor, readers: Opus `high`; elaboration and `proc`
semantics: Opus `xhigh` → `high`); the agent says when to switch.

## Sub-projects (decision #1)

| # | Sub-project | Depends on | Review | Model/effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2A | Source manager, AST, symbol table (shaped for the Phase 5 slang adapter) | Phase 1 | Peter (AST is a design rule) | Opus `xhigh` |
| 2B | Project readers in C (`.o3proj`, `-f`, `.qsf`/`.qpf`/`.qip`) against the corpus; preprocessor | 2A | light | Opus `high` |
| 2C | Verilog-2005 parser (Bison/Flex, Odin II lineage) covering the synthesizable subset (#3) | 2A | light | Opus `high` |
| 2D | Elaboration: parameters, `generate`, functions/tasks, signedness → word-level IR with processes | 2C | Peter (semantics) | Opus `xhigh` |
| 2E | `proc`: `always` → mux trees + `$dff*`, latch detection | 2D | light | Opus `xhigh` → `high` |
| 2F | `opt`: constant folding, dead-node removal, CSE, mux collapsing | 2D | light | Opus `high` |
| 2H | Exit-test harness: micros + VTR benchmarks vs Parmys, smallest first; fuzzing vs Yosys starts | grows alongside | light | Opus `high`; Sonnet for bulk |

Order: 2A → 2B ‖ 2C → 2D → 2E ‖ 2F, with 2H growing alongside.

## Decisions log

1. Phase 2 split as above, order 2A → 2B ‖ 2C → 2D → 2E ‖ 2F, 2H alongside (Peter, 2026-10-09).
2. **Titan deferred** (Peter, 2026-10-09): the test space for Phase 2 is the VTR benchmarks
   (`vtr_flow/benchmarks/verilog`, the larger designs included: `mcml`, `arm_core`, `LU*PEEng`,
   `bgm`, `stereovision*`, `mkDelayWorker32B`, …) plus the micros; the Titan download and the
   "smallest Titan design parsed from its `.qsf`" deliverable move to Phase 6 with VQM. Primitive
   library v0 (Altera cells for Titan) moves with it (agent default; it has no Phase 2 consumer).
3. **Parser**: Bison/Flex in the Odin II lineage (Peter, 2026-10-09). Before 2C, a coverage audit
   lists every synthesizable Verilog-2005 construct (IEEE 1364-2005, the IEEE 1364.1 synthesis
   subset, and the textbooks in `~/odin3-ws/BOOK_VERILOG_VHDL/`: Chu, *FPGA Prototyping by Verilog
   Examples*; Bhasker, *Verilog HDL Synthesis*) against the Odin II grammar, the micros and the VTR
   benchmarks; gaps become 2C requirements (`docs/specs/2026-10-09-2C-verilog-coverage.md`).
4. Exit bar: identical under `netlist-compare`, else equivalent under `equiv-check`, against Parmys;
   Odin II goldens are read-only references; Parmys-rejected micros are listed exceptions (Peter,
   2026-10-09).
5. Phase 1 agent defaults reviewed and kept (Peter, 2026-10-09): black-box ports matched by name
   (IR-7b), the simulator scratch-sizing hook, Yosys-simlib word-cell semantics and `$pmux` OR, the
   2^20 reader width cap, `odin3_attr_foreach` and `odin3_design_set_top`, ABI v3 naming and the
   enum move into `odin3.h`, the 1C BLIF rules, the project-grammar decisions of PHASE1 #19, and
   1G's decisions numbered #20/#21.
6. **Coverage audit** (`docs/specs/2026-10-09-2C-verilog-coverage.md`, 159 constructs: 100 MUST, 25
   SHOULD, 10 IGNORE, 24 REJECT) is the requirement list for 2C/2D; Odin II's grammar is a starting
   point, not a spec. Its decisions (Peter, 2026-10-09):
   - D1 `full_case`/`parallel_case` (attributes and `// synopsys` metacomments) honoured as Yosys
     does, with a warning per use;
   - D2 initial values: constant `initial` assignments, declaration initialisers and
     `$readmemh/b` set FF/RAM init values; other `initial` content ignored with a warning;
   - D3 tri-state: parse all; `z` drives elaborate to `$tribuf` only on top-level `inout`/output
     ports; an internal tri-state net is a located error until the IR has a tri-state net model;
   - D4 `wand/wor/triand/trior` resolve as AND/OR of their drivers; `uwire` is a `wire` with a
     single-driver check;
   - D5 illegal-but-Parmys-accepted forms (`input reg`, `input integer`) accepted with a located
     warning.
7. **AST (2A)** (Peter, 2026-10-09): arena storage with typed 32-bit IDs like the IR (compact node
   records: kind, location, child span, per-kind payload; explicit-stack traversal); one AST for
   parsed and elaborated forms (the slang adapter emits the elaborated subset); locations are
   file/line/col plus the macro-expansion and include chain; the symbol table is built during
   elaboration (2D), the parser records names only. Agent defaults: comments in a side table keyed
   by location; `(* *)` attributes kept on AST nodes and carried to the IR; the AST is freed after
   elaboration unless a pass asks to keep it.
